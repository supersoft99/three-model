# [Drape](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/aatishb/drape/master/index.html)
A [fabric design and simulation tool](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/aatishb/drape/master/index.html), built in [three.js](http://threejs.org/).

## Change log
- May 2: added multiple options for pinned constraints, option to avoid cloth self-intersections (very slow!)
- April 27: collision detection speedup (abandoned ray-tracing)
- April 12: improved collision detection, more intuitive GUI controls, made objects transparent
- April 5: added sliders GUI, mouse control (scroll to zoom, drag mouse to change view)
- March 22: added shear & bending springs, collision detection, friction, wireframe view

## To run online:

You can find the latest version of Drape [here](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/aatishb/drape/master/index.html)

## To run on your own computer:

If you're interested in developing drape further, you'll want to download the code and run it locally. Here's how to do that:

1. Download code and unzip
2. Easiest way to run: Open one of the .js files with the [p5 editor](http://p5js.org/download/) and press play
3. Alternatively, run the code with a local server (instructions [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally) or [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)).
